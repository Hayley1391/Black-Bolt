## About The Project

I started Black Bolt around January this year to serve as a server bot but he has grown alot since then and so have I. Black Bolt started off with only 200 lines of code and he now has
over 1500. He was only for our server in the beginning but now shares with 13 other partner and user servers. Black Bolt continues to grow everyday.
